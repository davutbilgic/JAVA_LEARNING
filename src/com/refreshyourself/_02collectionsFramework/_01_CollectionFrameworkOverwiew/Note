    ->What is collection?
        Simply an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit.

    ->Why do we nee it?
        Even though Array provide basic feature, it has many limitations like;
            -Not resizable
            -Not print friendly
            -Can not add and remove tem easily
            -ect...

    ->Benefits?
        -Reduces programming effort
        -Increases program speed and quality
        -Avoid reinventing the wheel
        -Fosters software reuse

    ->Collection Framework contain:
        -Interfaces
        -Implementations
        -Algorithm

    ->Collection:Provide base guideline for all other collections, Parent interface.
        List: Ordered Collection(indexed), May contain duplicate.
        Set: A Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.
        Queue: A Collection that Provide First-in-First-Out or Last-in-First-Out structure.
        Map: A Collection of Key-Value Pair.

    ->  Interface                          VS                       Implementation
        Multiple data structure                                     Specific Data Structure like ArrayList
        Functional Characteristic                                   Performance Characteristic
        Prefer as variable type                                     Concrete and Instantiable
        Often has popular implementation                            For example List interface has Arraylist
