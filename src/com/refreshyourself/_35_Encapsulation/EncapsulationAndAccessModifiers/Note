    -> Encapsulation;
        Restrict access to the inner workings of that class or any objects based on that class.
        It's also referred as information hiding of data hiding.

        Access modifiers is;
            -public
            -protected
            -default
            -private

        Access                  Same        Same            Sub-Classes          The rest of the
        modifiers               Class       Package         outside Package      world

        public                  Y           Y               Y                    Y
        protected               Y           Y               Y                    N
        default(no modifier)    Y           Y               N                    N
        private                 Y           N               N                    N



        **Good Encapsulation practice is:
            -Making instance fields private.
            -Provide public methods to access data or modify data;
                Those method are called getters and setters(Or accessor and mutator)
                By convention:
                                named as getXXX
                                and      setXXX

        If you provide only getter in a class, that class become IMMUTABLE.
